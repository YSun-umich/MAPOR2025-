For this year's Midwest Association of Public Opinion Research, I am examining the effects of neighborhood-level environmental factors on individual well-being. Three predictor variables I use are land cover, Walkscore, and recreational facility count. 

This folder contains Python scripts that calculate forest(greenness) and developed open space percentage using National Land Cover Data (NLCD). The code processes addresses by drawing a rough one-mile buffer around each individual's residential address, and calculating the percentage of forest/developed open space using the class number assigned by offcial NLCD site. 

The health data and individual information come from a previously completed health study focusing on Korean American adults (n=772). Responses were self-reported. Survey questions were drawn from American Community Survey and California Health Interview Survey.

The R script contains the complete process of data analysis (e.g., data cleaning, recoding, exploratory analysis,visualizations, model fitting, and model selection).
